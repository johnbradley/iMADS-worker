### Step 1: Install the worker and its dependencies
ADD requirements.txt /opt/tf-predictions-worker/
WORKDIR /opt/tf-predictions-worker
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

ADD . /opt/tf-predictions-worker/
ENV PATH /opt/tf-predictions-worker/:$PATH

### Step 2: Install LIBSVM, needed by predict-tf-binding
# Makefile has no install target, so we compile and update PATH
# Owned by root and placed in /opt

ENV LIBSVM_VER 321
RUN curl -SL https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm/archive/v${LIBSVM_VER}.tar.gz | tar -xzC /opt # makes /opt/libsvm-321
WORKDIR /opt/libsvm-${LIBSVM_VER}
RUN make

# Build shared lib for python bindings
WORKDIR /opt/libsvm-${LIBSVM_VER}/python
RUN make

# Install libsvm and python bindings
# These have no installer so we place the library and python bindings manually
RUN cp /opt/libsvm-${LIBSVM_VER}/libsvm.so* /usr/lib/
RUN ldconfig
RUN cp /opt/libsvm-${LIBSVM_VER}/python/*.py /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

### Step 3: Install Predict-TF-Binding from GitHub
WORKDIR /opt/
RUN git clone https://github.com/Duke-GCB/Predict-TF-Binding.git predict-tf-binding
RUN pip install -r /opt/predict-tf-binding/requirements.txt
ENV PATH /opt/predict-tf-binding/:$PATH

### Step 4: Install Predict-TF-Preference from GitHub
WORKDIR /opt/
RUN git clone https://github.com/Duke-GCB/Predict-TF-Preference.git predict-tf-preference
ENV PATH /opt/predict-tf-preference/:$PATH

# Switch to non-root user
RUN useradd -m worker
USER worker
